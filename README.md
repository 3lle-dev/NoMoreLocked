# NoMoreLocked🛡️

A simple tool to extract saved passwords from Chromium-based browsers and send them to a Discord channel. Built for **security research** and **educational purposes only**, not for shady stuff.
This is the first release of a bigger project 👾
You can grab it and integrate it into your own projects.

## Why Discord❓

Honestly? Because it’s kinda cool. Plus, Discord is rarely blocked in corporate environments... not that you should use it there! (Seriously, **don’t do anything dumb.**)

## How does it work?⚙️

- Extracts encrypted passwords from the browser’s SQLite database.

- Dump them using a Discord webhook.

- Decrypts them using a python module.


## Updates🤖

- The code has been updated, now the functions are more modular and defined so it's easier to read and copy the interested parts.

- Now on Discord is uploaded a file contained URLs, encrypted passwords and usernames in a json format, for a cleaner work.

- I've written in python a module to decrypt the passwords you have dumped on Discord.
